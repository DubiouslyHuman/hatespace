Create a generalized side information loader which takes in arbitrary functions.
(Does this work with just the text? Probably not given the graph stuff we would like to do...)
(The graph stuff might just be part of the basic data cleaning?)

For each function, also have a way to get the stats for that function on both its training distribution and the iron march data

(If we can make this general to any text corpus that would be great)
